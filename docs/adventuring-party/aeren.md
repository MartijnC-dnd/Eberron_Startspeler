## Characteristics

### Traits

I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets.
I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms.

### Ideals

People. I help the people who help me — that’s what keeps us alive.

### Bonds

I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to live on the streets.

### Flaws

It’s not stealing if I need it more than someone else.

## Profession

A **cartographer**, who tries to map the world after the *Last War* / *Day of Mourning*.  
Since the house **d'Sivis** specializes in communication and is actually also a bit of a notary, it is a task for them to check that all deeds are not yet "OK" and whether changes need to be made.

## What did i do during the last war?



## How did I get called into action

Enig idee **Sam**? Ik ben een thief/assassin for hire dus ik neem aan gewoon ingehuurd door **Elaydren d'Cannith**?

## Events (draft moet ik nog verder uitwerken)

### Started dating.

Claire Addington, Lawful Good Human Cleric that works as an Artisan. Our relationship was passionate but short because I had to leave for the last war.  
She is alive, but doing poorly due to finances. She disspeared without a trace after the last war.

### A heist went wrong

I nearly died. I have nasty scars on your body (hidden by my clothes), and I am missing a finger (left ring finger) due to torture.  
I got caught while my companions made it out. The guards tortured me for information (I did not yield).

### Tragedy during the last war

My lover disappeared without a trace. I have been looking (albeit passively) for that person ever since.

### Made an enemy

Bundrigo Hilltopple, Neutral Halfling that works as a Innkeeper. He is alive and quite successful.  
I caused several bar fights in his inn while staying there.

### Tragedy after the last war

I was imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit and spent 2 years in jail.  
They charged me with murder of a guard in a jewelry store. It was one of the other thiefs that did it.  
They all pinned it on me.
