## What did I do during the last war?

Nothing much. I lived my life in Korranberg for most of the time during the last war.

## How did I get called into action?

After the death of my grandfather who teached me the beginnings of artificing and elemental binding I figured there was more than just sitting in an ivory tower and only studying/reading. Lily feels the call to adventure which she inherited from her grandfather. Eventhough her grandmother doesnt approve this, she still went.

## Family

Lily Lyrreman D'Sivis is a granddaughter and heir of Lysse Lyrreman D'Sivis. Her mother was the daughter of Lysse Lyrreman D'Sivis and her father was a member of the Torralyn family. However she was born into the high ranked circles of house D'Sivis she had the best bond with her grandfather and husband of Lysse Lyrreman D'Sivis. Her grandfather was her best friend and learned her all things she knows about tinkering and elemental binding. They constructed her Mech suit together. For Lilies sweet 16 she got a Khyber shard to bind an elemental to her suit. This way she met Zap. Zap is the closest thing she ever had to a sibling. Zap, grandfather and lily were inseparable until her grandfather died only 6 months later.
